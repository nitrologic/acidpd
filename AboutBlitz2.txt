\INTRODUCTION

                         ABOUT BLITZ BASIC 2



Blitz BASIC 2 is a BASIC compiler for the Amiga computer from Acid Software a
New Zealand company dedicated to producing top quality software for the Amiga
user.

Blitz 2 comprises of a fully integrated editor/compiler environment providing
a serious, productive environment for the Amiga programmer.



*** BLITZ MODE ***


For the games programmer Blitz 2 offers a unique environment known as Blitz
mode. Closing down the operating system and replacing it with

- a kernal of super fast graphics

- specialised sound commands

- dedicated IO library

- precise display control

No longer does the Amiga programmer need to immerse themselves in assembler
and complex hardware manipulation to produce fast, professional games.



*** AMIGA MODE ***


For the applications developer Blitz 2 offers complete control of the Amiga's
multitasking, window based operating system. A comprehensive set of Workbench
2.0 compatible commands allow full control of

- screens

- windows

- menus

- gadgets

- intuitext

- IDCMP reports

An Intuition planner allows the creation of complex user interfaces quickly
and easily generating Blitz 2 source code that can be inserted straight
into Blitz 2 programs.


\PROGRAMMING FEATURES

                      *** PROGRAMMING FEATURES ***



Types and NewTypes
------------------

Blitz 2 supports the following numeric types:

  quick (fixed point)
  byte, word, long (integer)
  and fast floating point

String handling is extensively supported.

NewTypes can be defined (similar to C structures) allowing the BASIC
programmer to dramatically simplify their code. Arrays of NewTypes not
only dramatically reduces the number of arrays but speeds up the code.

NewTypes also allow Blitz programmers lower level access to the operating
system with all the structures used available as include files or resident
in the Blitz 2 environment.



Linked Lists
------------

As well as multi dimensional arrays Blitz 2 supports Linked-Lists. These
are single dimension arrays with a powerful command set providing
much greater control of the elements in the array. Elements can be
added, inserted and deleted to lists, sorting order can be retained,
processing of elements is simpler and quicker and code is not only easier
to read but performance is increased.



Extended BASIC program flow commands
------------------------------------

The following programming structures are supported in Blitz 2:

For..Next
While..Wend
Repeat..Until
Block If/Then/Else
Select..Case..Default..EndSelect
On..Goto & On..Gosub
Statements and Functions with shared/global variable support.
Multi levelled Interrupts

and so on and so on.....



\LIBRARIES

                                Libraries
                                ---------

Blitz 2 features a serious command library system that enables expansion
of the command set by the experienced machine code programmer. Utilities
to convert standard Amiga libraries and their .fd files to Blitz libraries
means that libraries such as midi.library, turtle.library and of course
all the external hardware support type libraries can be converted to Blitz 2
commands in a flash.

Documentation is included for the user to develop their own libraries.
Global variables from Blitz are available to commands added as well as
full access to structures and all other commands. Memory control is all
looked after by Blitz which will free up resources etc for the programmer.

The first Blitz newsletter includes source for several new libraries,
including a high speed serial port driver as well as commands to drive
the Amiga's speech device.



\AND MORE

InLine Assembler
----------------

The Blitz 2 compiler also includes an inline assembler as well as commands
to communicate between 68000 registers and BASIC variables etc. The assembler
can also be used as a standalone machine code environment.



Blitting
--------


Blitz 2 supports various modes of driving the Amiga's high speed Blitter
chip:

Blit will transfer a graphics image onto a bitmap

SBlit will use a 1 of 7 stencil bitmaps for 8 levels of Blitting priority

BBlit will buffer the background in memory so it may be restored afterward

QBlit keeps all blit information in a 'Queue' so all blits can be quickly
      erased

Block is for map type blitting, super fast word boundary blitting.



IFF support
-----------

Blitz 2 supports both IFF graphics and sound standards so files can be loaded
straight without need of conversion.



File Access
-----------

Sequential and Random access file handling are supported.



BlitzUser Magazine
------------------

Published on a regular basis BUM keeps Blitz User's up to date, so far
we have added MED support, anim brush and full scale anims, AGA palette
control, serial port commands, date time extensions, an advanced
runtime debugger, ARexx as well as publishing heaps and heaps of example
code and tutorial material
