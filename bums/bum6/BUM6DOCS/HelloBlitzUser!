Dear BUM Subscribers,


Welcome to BUM6. I'm sorry there is no magazine to go with
this issue. We will return to a magazine format in BUM7 I
promise (and you won't have to wait 4 months for it either!)

NZ Subscribers!

You will be receiving a letter regarding renewing your
subscription shortly. I am in the UK until the last week
of April but will get it sorted as soon as I am home.

Australian Subscribers

Many new users have sent their rego cards to me instead
of Roy Hurley, I have forwarded them back to him so please
contact RatBite Software as Roy is the man to talk to!

U.K. Users

Unfortunately Benoit has been very ill for the last 4 weeks
and so no support has been available from our Camden Town
offices. If you have received these disks then things are
back to normal. Expect a BBS online soon!

U.S. Users

Dave has now got AmigaNet on the BBS so please if you
haven't done so already get yourself a modem and get online.
BlitzAmi is worldwide online electronic mail network with
lots of Blitz Users everywhere loggging on. You are not
alone! And there is heaps of code being dumped on it each
week.


All Users!

Roy has done a small questionaire which I have labelled
RunMeOrDie. Please fill it in and mail it back on a disk
to your local Blitz support office.

Once you have had a chance to get to grips with BUM6 I'd
also like you to enclose a textfile named HelloAcid!. Just
edit the file in Ted and send it in...


Later,


Simon.
