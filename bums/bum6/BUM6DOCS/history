Blitz2 v1.80
------------


Ted
---

Yipeee, Ted now supports AGA screen modes! It should open a screen
the same frequency as WorkBench now.

Also, a new Debugger cludge is in the examples drawer that will
re-rout debugger to a screen instead of the sprite display which
is not much use to the few "power" users out there.


Library Fixes
-------------
String gadgets now give a gadgetup event when deselected, this means
that the user does not have to hit return after altering a string
gadget for the program to register the change.

Strings now have null termination in string memory. This means that
passing of multiple string parameters etc. works a lot better.

Debugger might start working on 040 machines, a flush cache was
missing in the evaluate function making it unusable. It's actually
quite useful being able to find out what variables are equal to
etc. There is also a cludge for

ASLPathRequest$ Title$,Pathname$ [,x,y,w,h] added to the ASL library
thanks to Andre Bergman, he's also changed "No more writes to a
ReadFile", ILBMInfo returns now a value(True or False), no need
for debuger, let the user check it out... WindowTags added, works
like ScreenTags, syntax:

WindowTags Window#,Flags,Title$ [,&TagList] or [[,Tag,Data]...]

GadTools and Display libraries have had many revisions so hopefully
they are ready for full use now.
