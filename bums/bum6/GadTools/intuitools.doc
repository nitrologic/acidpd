                      Intuitools v2.01

                Preliminary Documentation

                       April, 1994


Overview
========

Inutitools2 is a replacement project for the original Intuitools
program written by Mark. I've not had quite the enthusiasm to
polish it completely for BUM6 but the code included is working
and should be useful for those wanting to design gadget layout
especially with the Blitz2's new GadTools capabilities.

Unfortunately Intuitools2 will only work with WorkBench2.0 or
greater so those running 1.3 will need to stick with the original
IntuiTools. WB1.3 was the only platform it ran on reliably anyway!


Usage
=====

After running Intuitools2 select AddWindow. Then drag the mouse
across the screen to select the new window's dimensions.

After letting go of the mouse button the new window should
appear on the screen. You can then double click inside the
window to edit it's various flags and settings.

Once you have created a window you may then add gadgets. If no
window is open the screen will flash when you attempt to add
gadgets to the project.

To position the gadgets select inside the gadgets bounding
rectangle and drag with the mouse. To size select one of the
8 highlighted edges of the gadget and drag. Note that some
gadgets will be fixed in size depending on their contents
such as Blitz2 text gadgets and shape gadgets in general.

The Constant field will be used when source code is created.
Using constants for gadget and window numbers eliminates
problems when making alterations to the project. The constant
list created at the top of the source is also a useful
reference in your main program when including the ui source
in a separate file. It also makes your program much more
readable!

Anyway here follows description of the menus...


The Project Menu
================

Load - there are two .it example projects in this drawer that
       you can load stright into the Intuitools2 program.

Save - will save an it project, the format is completely ascii
       so people can download problem projects onto AmigaNet
       to help me debug the program.

Screen - change the resolution of the project's screen. Best to
         do this before creating windows as going from say hi to
         lo res may cause a runtime error if an existing window
         will not fit in the new screen.

Font - change screen font that is used by windows, gadgets etc.

Palette - not supported as of yet, sorry.

Test - use test to "run" your project. The second screen will
       come to the front and you are able to play with all the
       gadgets. Use the single menu option (QUIT) to return
       back to the editor screen.

Create - this option lets you create Blitz2 source code. At present
         shape gadgets will not produce source code and the GTList
         will be commented.

Quit - should succesfully exit.

The Options Menu
================

At present only two options are available-

Grid : locks all coordinated to the nearest word boundary.

AutoOption: When enabled the settings requester for windows
            and gadgets appears after they are created.
