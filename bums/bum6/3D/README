Paul Andrew's 3D editor...


I'm hoping to rerelease the 3D library in the next
issue of BUM. This editor was developed by Vision
Software and bares a close resemblance to a very
popular commercial product.

Sorry no docs, just put it here so you could have
a play and generally beleive that Blitz3D is on
it's way.

The program is AGA only as it uses a 32 colour hires
screen, I will get Paul to make it work on v2.0
Amigas also for next issue.

There are some objects you can load in, you can also
import simple Imagine objects if your clever. You
should also be able to change camera angle in the
perspective window and double click on faces to
bring up the attributes requester.


Finger's crossed for next issue!
