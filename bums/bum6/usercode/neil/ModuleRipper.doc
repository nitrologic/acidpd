Module Ripper 1.0

Neil O'Rourke 10-11-93


Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
This program was written to enable users to rip soundtracker modules off
NDOS disks and save them in a system friendy way.


To Use
~~~~~~
Simple.  Just double click on the icon, wait for the disk icon to come up on
your workbench that says DF0:BUSY.  You can now insert any format disk that
you like and DOS won't fill your screen with annoying requesters.  Neither
does VirusChecker.  Click on Start Ripping and wait.  After a minute or so
the entire contents of that disk will be read into RAM and scanning will
start.  If the program thinks it has found an ST module, a new window will
open with some module details.  If YOU think you have a module, select the
save gadget and type in a file name.

You can quit ripping at any time by clicking on Stop Ripping.  To quit,
select QUIT.  A racetrack display shows you how far you are into the
search.


Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~
An Amiga with Workbench 2 (or greater) and at least 2 meg of RAM.

The Future...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Module Ripper 2.0 is being created to give maximum features and help in
trying to rip modules from disks.  The program has been rewritten from the
ground up to include the following features...
	·Hunt for a module by name
	·More information on potential tracker modules
	·Save the disk buffer to another disk
	·A hex editor to edit the disk buffer
	·Sample Hunt function - play a disk through the audio system!
	·File functions to build NDOS data disks
	·Amiga Stye Guide compliant
	·Uses reqtools by Nico François for a much better interface
	·Uses 68020+ features where possible for better hunting

This program is a significant upgrade, but will be freely redistributal (as
opposed to public domain).
