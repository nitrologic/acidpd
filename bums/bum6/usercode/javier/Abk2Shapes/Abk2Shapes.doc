INFO
----

   This program takes an AMOS Sprite or Icon bank and transforms it into a
Blitz 2 compatible shape file. I used to program in AMOS in the past, but
after I moved to Blitz I thought how useful it could be to have a program
that converted objects between the two formats, mainly because I would be
able to port my programs much more easily then.

   I ignore if an utility of this kind does already exist, and whether it is
better than mine or not, but I'm making it freely distributable and hope it
will be welcomed by the users of both languages.


USEAGE
------

      Abk2Shapes can run from both Workbench and CLI. It needs source and
destination parameters, and will ask for any via a file requester if you
omit it. From Workbench you can only enter the first one, clicking on
the program and then on the source icon while holding down the Shift key.
The syntax for CLI is:

                      Abk2Shapes [source] [destination]

      You can also enter the '?' parameter for information.


BUG REPORTS, ETC.
-----------------

      I haven't extensively tested the program, but it should have no bugs.
If you find any, please tell me about it. If you feel like it, you could
also send in any sugerencies or contributions, that would encourage me to
keep on developing freely distributable software. You would also receive the
latest version of this program and of any other I had written then. One of
the improvements I'll make to this program in the next version is to be able
to convert Blitz shape files to AMOS banks as well.


AUTHOR, MACHINE AND COMPATIBILITY
---------------------------------

      This program was written on an A1200 equipped with 4MB of RAM and an
85MB HD, by Francisco Javier Diéguez Tirado, using Mark Sibly's stupendous
Blitz 2. It should be compatible with any Amiga, as this relies more on the
compiler than on my code.

      I'm currently a 17 year-old Spanish boy who will start to study
computer science next year. I like U2, Heroes del Silencio (great Spanish
group), Graphic adventures (specially old Sierra ones), and writing to
people worldwide. Send comments, contributions, etc. to:
