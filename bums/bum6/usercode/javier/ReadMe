Thanks to javier for these proggies

3d stuff...

These are just two examples from when I was beginning to program in Blitz2.
As you'll notice if you compile them, the second version is much faster,
because it makes use of linked lists instead of reading the information from
the Datas continuosly, as the first one does.

amos stuff...

In these drawers you'll find some useful utilities for AMOS and Blitz
programmers. Alongside Abk2Shapes, which comes with its own documentation,
there are two other ones:


AMOS_JoyRead   A simple routine that reads the joystick in the AMOS way.

AMOS_Banks     A handful of functions that allow you to load and manipulate
               AMOS Data banks in a similar way to the AMOS System. I'm
               currently working on it, and it will soon support all those
               "Reserve as" commands, as AMOS does.

shapecutter...

This program lays a bitmap out from a shape file. It is not finished,
because it doesn't have a GUI yet, but it works if you put the correct file
names in the listing and compile it from Blitz2.
