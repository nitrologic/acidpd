Hi

Due to popular demand, I decided to do a cludge so people could install
their own 8x8 font in the TED executable. The source code was published
here more as a joke than anything else, programming techniques used
should make you wonder what makes Acid Software tick.

Anyway make sure you have a back up of Ted, then type:

CLUDGETED topaz  (or any other fontname that has an 8x8 nonproportional font)

You should have a new file in your Blitz2: volume called Ted2, trying running
Ted2, if it's cool copy it ontop of Ted. Note, this cludge will only work
on original versions of Ted, not cludged ones, so don't go over the original!
