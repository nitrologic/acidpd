The following files are Blitz Basic 2 source code, and need BB2 v1.6 >
to compile (they use the new mutual exclude gadgets)

Tri.inc       (an include file)
"      .xtra  (compiler settings)
Tri.bb        (the main source)
"      .xtra  (compiler settings)
Graf.bb       (code used to make original graftemplate)
"      .xtra  (compiler settings)

The following files are needed to run Tri-Analyse


Tri           (executable)
