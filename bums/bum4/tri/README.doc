Tri-Analyse... Documentation for the user.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
========================================================================


                 I   M   P   O   R   T   A   N  T


This is the documentation on how to USE Tri-Analyse, READ it as this
programme has some peculiarities that you need to know about it. If
you have recieved this programme as part of the Blitz User Magazine,
then a description of the PROGRAMMING involved and Blitz techniques
etc is printed in the magazine.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This part of the documentation is for the Triathlete who wants to use
the programme to monitor his training.

PART 1: System Requirements

Amiga 500/600/2000/3000/1200/4000 with 512k mem (1 meg recommended)
A hard drive is also nice though not necessary.

PART 2: Making a Bootable floppy disk for Tri-Analyse

The Standard WBench 1.3 or 2.04 boot disk can be used, simply strip off
all the utils you dont use, all the prefs etc, change the startup-sequence
to a simple LoadWB, copy all the Tri-Analyse stuff to df0:, install a copy
of your favourite text editor (one that does NOT run as a background task)
make sure the fonts provided go into your FONTS: drawer, and you should be
away, make sure you leave the Wbench libs and devs there, also makesure (if
you are running 1.3) that you have the RUN command in your c: directory

I have tested Tri-Analyse under WB 3 / 2.1 / 2.04 / 1.3 and am 99.99% sure
it will run ok under 1.2, so if you follow above directions you should be
fine.

PART 3: Installing to a HDD

Assuming you have the standards libs: and devs etc on your bootable hardrive
then simply copy the fonts supplied with Tri-Analyse to your FONTS: directory
and Make a dir for Tri-Analyse somewhere on your HD and copy all the rest of
the files in this archive to there.

PART 4: OK, what the hell is this programme.

This programme is something I knocked up for my self to allow me to easily
set up/recall a Triathlon training system on a monthly basis, It also has
a graphing facility so that I can save my resting heart-rate for the day
and view it in a graphical form for the month.

WARNING: I knocked this up in a couple of days, therefore the way it does
things is a trifle cheesy (I don't mean it does nasty things to your system
simply that I took the lazy way of doing a couple of things. So the system
is not SUPER FLASH, however it's the best thing Ive found for keeping a
training diary (used to use WordPerfects Calender) and its quite reliable
once you get used to it.

PART 5: MORE IMPORTANT STUFF

a) make sure when you start Tri-Analyse that you are IN the actual
   directory it all resides in (opening wbench draws and starting it
   from the WBench does it automatically) if you start from the CLI
   and say Tri is in dh0:applications/databases/training/

   If you start Tri when you reside in dh0: you are going to have no
   joy whatsoever, so CD to dh0:applications/databases/training/
   and THEN start it

b) you need a RAM: disk called RAM:

   This is because I save temporary files there, if you dont have one

   a) Make one
   b) assign ram: to somewhere on your system (it only ever creates one
      temporary file and keeps on writing over it so it wont use much
      space.

c) Make sure you installed the fonts supplied to FONTS:

d) Make sure the text editor you use does not run as a detached task

   As this was originally intended as my use only thats no probs, however
   If you use Cygnus-Ed or similar either start it using your Tri-Analyse
   prefs with a switch that makes it non background (if you can) or use
   a non background editor like Blitz 2's TED or commordores ED (if you
   have to.....)

e) if you run pre 2.04 OS then makesure RUN is in the C: directory

Phew now it should work

PART 6: How to use it

Assuming you have installed it correctly, when you either

a) click on the Tri ICON or
b) execute the Tri programme from the CLI

you should be presented with a big screen full of gadgets and stuff
this is the main Tri-Analyse screen. If this does not appear.. go to
the OH GOD IT DONT WORK section.

If this is the first time you have run it, it will moan about to PREFS
file for it, thats ok, you just need to set up your default text editor
for it. more on that later

If you are used to Amiga applications everything should be very obvious
if you are a seasoned Tri-Athlete, the terminology on some of the gadgets
will be obvious too. Lets go through them all


EDIT INFO. This gadget is used when you have selected a discipline and
           a type of training and a valid date, then you click this button
           to start your text editor of choice, and enter that training.

SAVE INFO. This saves a data file for the current open month.

QUIT       This quits Tri-Analyse, if you have a data file open, it will
           ask you if you wish to save it before you quit.

EDITOR.    This is where you enter the command line prefs for your text
           editor, simply if your editor was TED and it resided in
           ROOT:blitz2/ you would enter in here.

           ROOT:blitz2/ted
           Dont enter trailing spaces or a filename here or it will muck up

FONT.      This is disabled, its never been used and never will be :-)


DATE.      If you want anything to work then this is the one you have to set
           up, if you do not enter the date in DD/MM/YY format here none of
           the other gadgets will do anything. The date automatically creates
           training files for a new month, and if you change months, saves the
           old month before loading a new one. ie: its automatic, however when
           you quit out of the programme, choose to save the last month of data
           as otherwise its gone.

RHR.       This is where you enter your resting heart rate in the morning, ie:
           take your pulse for a minute when you first wake up and put it in
           here. Your only allowed 3 numbers but that's ok cos if you had a
           heartrate of 999 you'd be well and truly dead..... :-)


DISCIPLINE Simply click on which discipline gadget you want to read/enter
           training for.

TYPE.      Click on what type of training you are doing

READ TO... Click on read todays training to... DA DA DA read the training for
           the specified discipline on the specified day

GRAPH MO.. Click on this to display a Graph of you resting heart rate over
           the currently active month.


Ok assuming you have followed me this far lets run through entering
a training session


First of all enter a date (ie 15/12/93) and press return

Now click on what discipline you are training (you can do all 3
each day if you want) say CYCLING

Now click on what type of CYCLING training you are doing ie (SPRINT)

Now click on edit info to type in your training for the day and save
it using your editors save command (should be called ram:temp if your
editor takes filenames as command line arguments, if it doesn't, use
a different editor, sorry.....

Now enter your resting heart rate for the day (say hmm... 38 nice and fit)

Ok now if you were also doing running that day then you could click on
RUNNING and the type (say ENDURANCE) and go through and edit that type
of training. Note you only do your heartrate once as you only have one
resting heartrate.

Ok now click on save data (writes the info to disk)

Now if you click on CYCLING for that date the type of training will jump
to SPRINT cos thats what you said you were doing, try Reading the days
training, a nice little text reader should pop up and show you it.

Try graphing your resting heart rate for the month.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

We've now covered all the features, although I'm sorry very briefly. You
should now understand how to enter stuff for a month, you can change dates
re-alter your training types, etc etc as many times as you like, just
experiment and you'll soon have it sussed. Just one or two quick notes
before I leave. (Ive just come off a 16 hour shift at work and its time to
get some zzzzzzzzzz's)

a) when entering text you can put a backslash then a quick desc and when its
   viewed back in the text editor that will pop up as a gadget down the bottom
   where if you click on it you will be taken to that part of the text ie:

   \REMEMBER!
   To put your shoes on when you go running

   Will put a REMEMBER! Gadget down the bottom that if you click on it will take
   you to the 'To put your shoes...' part of the text. A little HyperText type
   of thing.

b) If it looks like the wrong stuff is going in the wrong date remember when you
   activate a string gadget. (A gadget you type into) you must finish your entry
   by pressing RETURN, NOT JUST BY CLICKING THE MOUSE ON ANOTHER GADGET!!!!

   This is how the amiga handles string gadgets, if you dont press return then
   its just like you have not entered the data. Therefore if you for example
   correctly entered a date of 01/01/93 <RETURN> entered a heart rate of
   50 <return> then entered 03/01/93 <FORGOT RETURN> and entered a heartrate
   of 30<return> you would have actually altered the heartrate for the
   01/01/93 so remember those returns....


Ok by now, the way I've described this thing, you probably thing you don't
want to even try it, however, if you have had a bit of amiga experience
its a piece of cake to use, and dare I say it, actually quite nice to use too.

I am assuming you know what the use of monitoring your resting heart rate is
(its the best indicator that you are getting fitter if it drops and that you
are over-training or have a bug, if it suddenly rises. If you do find this
programme usefull, dont send me money or anything (wouldn't be cheeky enough
to expect any for it!!

But I would like.

a) Photocopies of any interesting Training articles, techniques, programmes
   that have worked for you.

b) Someone to write some DECENT docs for this once they are familiar with it

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE OH MY GOD IT DOESN'T WORK SECTION

a) Don't even see the initial screen

   - Moved your fonts to the right place?
   - is diskfont.library in your libs: drawer?
   - are you in the directory with all of tri's files

b) My text editor is not starting up

   - Make sure its NOT a background process one
   - Make sure your prefs are set and correct
   - Make sure your editor accepts a command line argument for the filename
   - Make sure there are no trailing spaces or chars in you prefs string
   - If pre 2.04 OS make sure RUN is in the c: directory

c) I cant get a graph up

   - is the file graftemplate in your current dir?
