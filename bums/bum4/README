HI,

Welcome to the BUM4 cover disk, no workbench interface this time, I
figure Blitz2 programmers are up to using the CLI!

Anyway, I've tried to put a README in each directory.

This root directory contains:

New Blitz2 v1.6 including Blitz2 Ted and Deflibs all should be copied
to your Blitz2: volume as usual.

The blitzlibs.lha is only for those developing their own libraries, also
for these advanced users is the libsdev drawer that has some good source
code. Oh, anyone with Opal or Retina graphics boards will want to have
a look in there too.

The quikasm and insectoids archives have been included as they both have
had to been changed with the new version of Blitz2.

Then theres SKIDMARKS, sorry no source code as yet, still tidying it up,
we'll try and include it in the next issue.

Oh, to use LHA, Stefan Boberg's choice archive standard do this:

lha e archivename dirctory/  (don't forget the / after the directory name)

I find it best to:

 lha e archivename ram:

Then copy the files from ram, this way you know what's going where.

Hey Blitz Users, we need some contributions for next month so get onto it!


Hmm, better add a bit more description:

  README
  blitz2.lha    ;blitz2 ted & deflibs (need to go in your Blitz2: volume)
  examples.lha  ;lots of examples
  includes.lha  ;system includes for accessing system libraries
  insect.lha    ;new insectoids2 files (to work with new palette object)
  quikasm.lha   ;new source to work with v1.6
  skidmarks.lha ;new pd game to show your mates (its in Blitz2)
  blitzlibs.lha ;for advanced library development
  lha           ;the program you need to use to unarchive the above

Hope I haven't stuffed up too many things.

Simon
