This drawer contains new/updated files for the BlitzLibs: volume,
this is only relevant for people wishing to develop Blitz 2 libraries.

We decided to drop the .info files for all the .obj files, so if
I was you I'd delete them all, they were the wrong names anyway!

So the new .obj files in basic.lha do not show up from
workbench, but they are there! If you are not familiar with the
CLI this drawers not for you in any case....

The new libmacs.res file contains several constants documented in
the magazine that were previously omitted.

More developers documentation such as source for amigalibs.res will
be available shortly.

Thanks,

Simon.
