welcome aboard, captain. starfleet have heard many good things about you,
 and we feel sure you will live up to your reputation.
 .before assigning you a priority mission, we must first ask you to perform
 a simple but necessary task.

_T 1 thank you for your cooperation captain. the task simply involves travelling
 to the mining station at @FP 02 and picking up up some lithium to be returned
 to us at this starbase.

greetings captain. i'm afraid you have just made a rather large mistake! what you
 have on your ship is not a container of lithium, but a deutronium bomb!
 have a nice day!

you scoundrel!
