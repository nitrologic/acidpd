BLITZ USER 3 COVER DISK

* the new TED now lets you hit RETURN for OK gadgets and ESC for CANCEL

* use TAB key to swap between string gadgets if running 2.0 or higher

* ignore library not found errors when loading progs for first time with 1.5

* libtools.lha includes blitzlibs, new libmanager etc. for advanced users

* 3D library will be re-released soon, copy User2 3dlibs into blitzlibs:basic
  if you are hacking around with pre-release version

Please do not spread executable versions of insectoids or buzzbar as
they will be released on PD Disk3 which we hope to get on the coverdisk
with some major Amiga magazines.

Please report any bugs in new version AS SOON AS POSSIBLE directly
to Acid Software.

We have converted all Workbench 3.0 libraries as well as ASL library
and others. Work is underway to support all the new features so keep
hassling us.

Don't forget to send in the questionaire...

Thanks,

Simon
