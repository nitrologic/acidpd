This small library provides quick and easy to use commands for accessing
AppWindows, AppIcons and AppMenus.

* PLEASE NOTE * 
This library must have at least V37+ of Workbench/DOS/Icon libraries

This version of the library only enables you to read the FIRST file
dragged to an AppWindow/AppIcon or selected from an AppMenu - future
versions will have additional commands AppWindowArg/AppIconArg/AppMenuArg
which returns the filename of the specified arg. E.g. f$=AppIconArg(1)

Command List:

  AppEvent()
  AppWindowEvent()
  AppIconEvent()
  AppMenuEvent()
  AddAppWindow()
  AddAppIcon()
  AddAppMenu()
  DelAppWindow()
  DelAppIcon()
  DelAppMenu()
  AppWindowFile()
  AppIconFile()
  AppIconHit()
  AppMenuFile()

Function : AppEvent
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes  : Amiga
Syntax : status=AppEvent

This command checks the msg ports of any open AppIcons/AppWindows/AppMenus
and if an event has been passed, returns -1. 0 indicates no event has
occurred.

e.g.
  Repeat
    VWait
  Until AppEvent


Function : AppWindowEvent

Modes  : Amiga
Syntax : status=AppWindowEvent

This command checks the msg ports of any open AppWindows and if an event
has been passed, returns -1. 0 indicates no event has occurred.

Function : AddAppWindow
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes  : Amiga
Syntax : success=AddAppWindow(windownumber)

This command attempts to make the window specified by 'windownumber' to become
an AppWindow. -1 means success, 0 means failure. There is a currently
limit of 4 AppWindows.


Function : AddAppIcon
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes  : Amiga
Syntax : success=AddAppIcon(id,text$,iconname$)

This command attempts to place an AppIcon onto the Workbench desktop.
ID is a unique identification number. Text$ is text to display underneath
the AppIcon and Iconname$ is the name of the file to use the Icon imagery.
-1 means success, 0 means failure.
e.g.
  suc=AddAppIcon(0,"Test","Work:Test")
  If suc=0 Then End
  

Function : AddAppMenu
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Syntax : success=AddAppMenu(id,text$)

This command tries to add 'text$' to the Tools menu of Workbench.
ID is a unique identification number. Returns -1 for success, 0 for failure.
e.g.
  suc=AddAppMenu(0,"Blitz2")
  If suc=0 Then End


Function : AppWindowFile
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes  : Amiga
Syntax : filename$=AppWindowFile(windownumber)

This command returns the complete path of the file which was dragged to the
AppWindow. If the file was in fact a directory a '/' is appended.
An empty string signifies nothing was Dragged.


Function : AppIconFile
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes  : Amiga
Syntax : filename$=AppIconFile(id)

This command returns the complete path of the file which was dragged to the
AppIcon. If the file was in fact a directory a '/' is appended.
An empty string signifies nothing was Dragged.


Function : AppMenuFile
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes  : Amiga
Syntax : filename$=AppMenuFile(id)

This command returns the complete path of the file which was selected when
the AppMenu was hit. If the file was in fact a directory a '/' is appended.
An empty string signifies nothing was selected.


Function : AppIconHit
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes  : Amiga
Syntax : status=AppIconHit(id)
   idnumber=AppIconHit

This command returns the status of the AppIcon <id>. -1 = The icon was
doubleclicked, 0 = nothing has happened.
If no argument is supplied, the function returns the number of the
doubleclicked icon, or -1 for none.


Function : AppMenuHit
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes  : Amiga
Syntax : status=AppMenuHit(id)
   idnumber=AppMenuHit

This returns the status of the AppMenu item <id>. -1 = This menu
item was selected, 0 = This menu item was not selected.
If no argument is given, the function returns the numbe of the
selected menu item, or -1 for none.


Function : DelAppWindow/DelAppIcon/DelAppMenu
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Modes  : Amiga
Syntax : success=DelAppWindow[(number)]
   success=DelAppIcon[(id)]
   success=DelAppMenu[(id)]

These commands will remove the AppWindow/AppIcon/AppMenu from the system
and free up the associated message ports.

*** IMPORTANT *** You must call DelAppWindow BEFORE closing a window,
or your machine will GURU!
