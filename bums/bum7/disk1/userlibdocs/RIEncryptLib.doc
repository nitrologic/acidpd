You can have this little library if you like.  Sorry there are no full docs in
the archive - the lib was done in a hurry for someone.  It performs Enigma
compression and is very cute ;-).
The archive contains the source code for the library.  I'm sure it wouldn't
take you a second to have a look at it ;-).


Commands in the library:

  Encrypt memadr,len[,wheel1,wheel2,wheel3]

              This will encrypt a block of memory starting at the address and
running through to addresslength-1.  The optional wheel parameters allow you to 
specify the start positions of the three wheels.  If you leave these out then
the wheels' start positions will be randomised.

  GetWheel n

    This will tell you the position that wheel n stopped at after
encrypting a file.  n can range from 1 to 3 - YOU MUST REMEMBER THESE POSITIONS
IF YOU WANT TO DECRYPT THE FILE (at the moment at least).

  Decrypt memadr,len,wheel1,wheel2,wheel3

    Same Encrypt except that it does the opposite and the wheel
positions ARE NOT OPTIONAL.  The positions should be the ones you wrote down
after encrypting the file.  I may, in future, change it so that you can also
specify the start wheel positions instead of the end ones (shouldn't be tooooo
hard ;-)).


Oh well, have a look and tell us what you think............
