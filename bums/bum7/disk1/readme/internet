Simon's Quick and Dirty guide to the Internet.

For those Blitz users who are equipped with modem and not on the
Internet I strongly suggest getting an account.

From where? These days commercial services are popping up everywhere
and all sorts of magazines are advertising running articles and
adverts about the new information highway.

Anyway, either call your local university or ask about it on a local
BBS and get an account.

With your account you get an email address, which is like an electronic
mailbox. You can then send a message to the blitzlist which will
connect you with all other blitz users on the net, including me
here at acid@iconz.co.nz

I along with several other users are able to answer any questions
and hopefuly sort out any problems you are having usually within
24 hours often less. Of course you get the opportunity to meet
heaps of different people and can exchange ideas, gripes and
generally extend your social circles into cyberspace. Yuck, what
kind of terminology is that...

Anyway it's good fun and can be very useful for furthering your
programming aspirations so email the blitz list today and introduce
yourself to the rest of us...
