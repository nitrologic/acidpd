Acid plans for Blitz


OK, things have been a little hazy for the last few months.

First up, the Amiga is currently out of production, being September
and still no one gearing up for a production run for XMas we are all
a little sad.

Personally I thought it was OK C= had gone under they never new
what was good for them anyway. Whenever they wanted to make more
money they cut advertising, sacked R&D and increased management
budgets. The result being a company that is worth very little and
a management team with enough money to buy the company? Hmmm....

The other result is small companies like ourselves having to do
jobs we don't want to do because our primary market is now looking
to decrease rapidly (Amiga users prepared to spend $$$). End result
being Blitz is still a labour of love and doesn't come anywhere
close to paying our tax bills.

However the good news is we are releasing a new package for XMas,
which will include ringbound documentation and the latest version
of Blitz2. I want to call it Blitz3, even though the advances may
not warrant such a jump, I think putting all the stuff we have
added in the last 2 years in a new package with a new name will
make enough people happy.

Everyone who has subscribed to Blitz User Magazine will be given
a discounted upgrade price, and of course if we sell enough copies
we'll be able to put a lot more effort into our ongoing development
in the new year.


Simon.
