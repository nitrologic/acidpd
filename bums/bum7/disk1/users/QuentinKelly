Dear Simon,

My name is Quentin Kelly.

I just thought I'd drop you a quick note after finally
receiving BUM6 you sent me a corrupt copy of disk1! (enclosed for re-copy).
                   (insert creative ^^^ abuse here).

I hear that you are going to have a penpals directory in
your next issue. Please include the following details as
I would really enjoy receiving mail and swapping code
with other users, especially in other countries

Small things I'd like to see added to Blitz2:

You should release the new commands in a ring bound style book set out like
the big command manual, so that you can update the command book very easily.
Ya know like those things you see
on TV, get part 1 for 99 cents, easily updated when you release new
commands in Blitz User magazine, just put it in the binder!. Although i am
a new user to blitz, i have found finding the new commands a bit of a pain
if i have to look through 2 manuals and one without an index pointing them
out like the larger command manual. Cool idea eh ?

Large things I'd like to see added to Blitz2:


I think the new commands in this issue are corrupt too (re-copy). I hope
this isn't standard practice of Acid.

( ) I'd like to register with the authors via Acid
     Software so I can receive upgrades and docs
     directly from them

(x) I'd like to see the user libraries continually
     updated in BUM magazine and the authors paid
     by Acid and not some shareware system

( ) I don't think I'm quite ready for new commands
     Blitz2 has enough for me already

I'm currently working on....Don't laugh now...

Name  :Cartoon Fighters, Body Count or something else when thought of
Type  :Beat'em Up
Specs :A1200HD ONLY -The 'Lotsa Disks' syndrome = 'Lotsa Loading' syndrome
   640x256x64 (Lotsa detail, ala skidmarks AGA cars)
   500-650k per character, 2-2.5 screens background, music ? 
Release :UNKNOWN

Huge 150x120+ characters, about 14 characters, parallax and movement in the 
backgrounds like SF and MK should have had, secret stuff, 3 button JS required
maybe. I don't know whether B&W or colour gfx should be used. B&W would be
original and easier, also greater speed and real cartoon look.
Colour for greater looks but would then look like everything else. Hidden
goodies and greeblies like MK2 (!), special Brutalities and funalities,
really brutal and humorous 'finishing moves' not unlike fatalities and
friendships. Blood, dunno as yet, wouldn't be too hard. hardcore sound fx
and music. 2 months thought so far, expect 6 more before anything starts.
Get everything planned to perfection and see if we can reproduce it. It
should look like 'Tube Warriors' and play like MK2, well thats the idea.


I have enclosed nothing for publishing in BUM7...

(  ) Seeing as the article I have enclosed is so good I would
     like you to send me more information about becoming a full
     time BUM editor.


Anyway, get back to work, I want to see BUM7 in my mailbox
next week!
