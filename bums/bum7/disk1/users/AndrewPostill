Small things I'd like to see added to Blitz2:
A delete line function and the function that moves all commands on current
line onto a new line so you can see all the line if required

Large things I'd like to see added to Blitz2:
More commands and Technical support and a decent Manual

I think the new commands this issue are the disk and String Handeling commands

(yes) I'd like to register with the authors via Acid
     Software so I can receive upgrades and docs
     directly from them

(yes) I'd like to see the user libraries continually
     updated in BUM magazine and the authors paid
     by Acid and not some shareware system

(YES) I think I'm quite ready for new commands


I'm currently working on a Database program....

I have enclosed the following for publishing in BUM7...

Programs  Alarm Clock




Anyway, got 18 days off work so I can work on the Database program,

I want to see BUM7 in my postbox  Before September 1994 please


Best Regards,



MR A J Postill
