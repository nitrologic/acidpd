Dear Simon,

My name is Anthony Bebbington.

I just thought I'd drop you a quick note after finally
receiving BUM6 you ( I decided not to add any abusive.
comments as by now I think you know how we all feel about
the delays in delivering BUMs')

I hear that you are going to have a penpals directory in
your next issue. Please include the following details as
I would really enjoy receiving mail and swapping code
with other users, especially in other countries

               trying to learn Blitz
----------------------------------------------------------

Small things I'd like to see added to Blitz2:

A text file of all the commands included into Blitz since
the manuals were printed as having to flick through the BUM's
is a pain.


Large things I'd like to see added to Blitz2:

Better manuals !!!!
While the manuals might be clear to more advanced programmers,
they are no help to beginners like myself, you need to either
rewrite the existing manuals with larger and clearer explanations
of the various commands, or write a beginners guide to Blitz,
which takes nothing for granted and clearly tells them how to
do things in Blitz.

A new set of manuals with ALL the new commands included
as I am quickly losing track off all the new commands, or
atleast a text file like requested in the above section.

A utility to convert AMOS source code to Blitz so you could
show the AMOS users what Blitz can do  :-)


I think the new commands this issue are good, but I haven't really.
used them properly yet.

(  ) I'd like to register with the authors via Acid
     Software so I can receive upgrades and docs
     directly from them

(XX) I'd like to see the user libraries continually
     updated in BUM magazine and the authors paid
     by Acid and not some shareware system

(  ) I don't think I'm quite ready for new commands
     Blitz2 has enough for me already

I'm currently working on....

trying to get to grips with Blitz though the manuals are
not helping.


I have enclosed the following for publishing in BUM7...


Code      ________________________________________

Programs  ________________________________________

Articles  ________________________________________


(  ) Seeing as the article I have enclosed is so good I would
     like you to send me more information about becoming a full
     time BUM editor.


Anyway, get back to work, I want to see BUM7 in my mailbox
next week!


Regards,
        Anthony

(please mail this as a file, do NOT print it out!!!!)
