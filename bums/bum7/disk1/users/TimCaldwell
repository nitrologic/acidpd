Dear Simon,

My name is Tim Caldwell.

I just thought I'd drop you a quick note after finally
receiving BUM6 you ________CREATIVE ^^^ ABUSE HERE___ (OK, old joke)
                   (insert creative ^^^ abuse here).

I hear that you are going to have a penpals directory in
your next issue. Please include the following details as
I would really enjoy receiving mail and swapping code
with other users, especially in other countries
like Italy (Pizza capital of the world)

Small things I'd like to see added to Blitz2:

  * Free Pizza tokens with every BUM.
  * The ASL screen requester should come up configured to the current
    screens settings. Hitting OK with the default parameters returns
    an incorrect ViewMode of 0.
  * Better support for adding copper instructions to clists generated
    using the new display library. The ability to get the address of the
    instruction inserted so that instructions can be modified every frame
    if so desired.
  * Strings that work.

Large things I'd like to see added to Blitz2:

  * NEW TED (WB 2/3)
  * LINKER
  * 68020 SUPPORT


I think the new commands this issue are OK, but more time should be
spent getting the existing commands working !

(\/ ) I'd like to see the user libraries continually
      updated in BUM magazine and the authors paid
      by Acid and not some shareware system

(/\ ) I don't think I'm quite ready for new commands
      Blitz2 has enough for me already

I'm currently working on.... Page 2 of the Pizza menu.

I have enclosed the following for publishing in BUM7...

(\/ ) Seeing as the article I have enclosed is so good I would
      like you to send me more information about becoming a full
      time BUM editor.


Anyway, get back to work, I want to see BUM7 in my mailbox
next week [gee, whas that a pig flying past my window ? cue to pic
of "ACE VENTURA, PET DETECTIVE" (spoken in silly voice)] !


Regards,

  TIM.
  

WHERE CREDIT IS DUE
Personally I think that allowing your users to get upgraded libraries
(or DEFLIB file) directly from the authors of various commands is a
bad idea. Imagine the incompatability problems that may arise due
to different users having different versions of commands from different
authors.
I think that any library extensions should be released through ACID who
can keep a constant check on the quality of any new additions. I think
that the way things work at the moment with BUM subscribers receiving
the latest stuff is great. If it works why break it ?
