I hear that you are going to have a penpals directory in
your next issue. Please include the following details as
I would really enjoy receiving mail and swapping code
with other users, especially in other countries

Small things I'd like to see added to Blitz2: BUG FIXES!


Large things I'd like to see added to Blitz2: BUG FIXES!


I think the new commands this issue aren't any of your own.

( ) I'd like to register with the authors via Acid
     Software so I can receive upgrades and docs
     directly from them

(X ) I'd like to see the user libraries continually
     updated in BUM magazine and the authors paid
     by Acid and not some shareware system

(  ) I don't think I'm quite ready for new commands
     Blitz2 has enough for me already

I'm currently working on....Blitz libraries

I have enclosed the following for publishing in BUM7...


Code      Examples for our libraries

Programs  Libraries and Map Editor

Articles  ________________________________________


(  ) Seeing as the article I have enclosed is so good I would
     like you to send me more information about becoming a full
     time BUM editor.
   /
(\/) Seeing as our libraries are so good, we think we should be
     paid per BYTE used in BUM7.

Anyway, get back to work, I want to see BUM7 in my mailbox
tomorrow!


Regards,

    Reflective Images aka Steven Matty & Stephen McNamara
