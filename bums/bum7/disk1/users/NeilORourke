Dear Simon,

My name is Neil O'Rourke

I just thought I'd drop you a quick note after finally
receiving BUM6 you lowlife scum with camel-flea infested armpits and who
smells like a baked dinner three months after the fact with maggots
crawling in and out of the meat with blowflies crawling around it.
                   (insert creative ^^^ abuse here).

I hear that you are going to have a penpals directory in
your next issue. Please include the following details as
I would really enjoy receiving mail and swapping code
with other users, especially in other countries

Small things I'd like to see added to Blitz2:
current bugs fixed

Large things I'd like to see added to Blitz2:
A debugger that works on my machine
the much-promised 3D library
a linker that can link different code modules together
section/hunk support

I think the new commands this issue are great.

(  ) I'd like to register with the authors via Acid
     Software so I can receive upgrades and docs
     directly from them

(X ) I'd like to see the user libraries continually
     updated in BUM magazine and the authors paid
     by Acid and not some shareware system

(  ) I don't think I'm quite ready for new commands
     Blitz2 has enough for me already

I'm currently working on....
multimedia

I have enclosed the following for publishing in BUM7...


Code      ________________________________________

Programs  ________________________________________

Articles  ________________________________________


(x ) I would like you to send me more information about becoming a full
     time BUM editor.


Anyway, get back to work, I want to see BUM7 in my mailbox
next week!


Regards,


(please mail this as a file, do NOT print it out!!!!)
