Small things I'd like to see added to Blitz2:


Large things I'd like to see added to Blitz2:


I think the new commands this issue are Fucking hard for a dweeb to get going.
   /
(\/ ) I'd like to register with the authors via Acid
     Software so I can receive upgrades and docs
     directly from them
   /
(\/ ) I'd like to see the user libraries continually
     updated in BUM magazine and the authors paid
     by Acid and not some shareware system  (will this make it even harder for me to use ?)

(  ) I don't think I'm quite ready for new commands
     Blitz2 has enough for me already

I'm currently working on....   A project I think you already know about from "electronic sweatshop"

I have enclosed the following for publishing in BUM7...


Code      Bouncing Balls, Plasma    (two tuition programs)

Programs  Disk-Base, IFF-Halver   (two utilities)

Articles  ________________________________________


(  ) Seeing as the article I have enclosed is so good I would
     like you to send me more information about becoming a full
     time BUM editor.


Anyway, get back to work, I want to see BUM7 in my mailbox
next week!
