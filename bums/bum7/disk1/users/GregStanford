My name is Greg Stanford.

I just thought I'd drop you a quick note after finally
receiving BUM6 you sure took your time, but I can understand why.
                   (insert creative ^^^ abuse here).

I hear that you are going to have a penpals directory in
your next issue. Please include the following details as
I would really enjoy receiving mail and swapping code
with other users, especially in other countries

Small things I'd like to see added to Blitz2: Load 24 bit IFF's as bitmaps


Large things I'd like to see added to Blitz2: Support for DataTypes Library


I think the new commands this issue are very good, keep 'em coming.

( ** ) I'd like to register with the authors via Acid
     Software so I can receive upgrades and docs
     directly from them

( ** ) I'd like to see the user libraries continually
     updated in BUM magazine and the authors paid
     by Acid and not some shareware system

(  ) I don't think I'm quite ready for new commands
     Blitz2 has enough for me already

I'm currently working on.... many things

I have enclosed the following for publishing in BUM7...


Code      ________________________________________

Programs  Not this time around, maybe in an issue or so's time

Articles  ________________________________________


(  ) Seeing as the article I have enclosed is so good I would
     like you to send me more information about becoming a full
     time BUM editor.


Anyway, get back to work, I want to see BUM7 in my mailbox
next week!


Regards,


(please mail this as a file, do NOT print it out!!!!)
