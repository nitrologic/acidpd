Dear Simon,

There's a whole shitload of includes that need to be compiled with
Ratreader, and a picture I've included in the executable using the 
rough but effective method of INCBINing it and Bsaveing it to ram: etc.

Also of some of my includes may be of interest to users,
check out Search, replace the Reqtools library etc.

You'll need a GT fastmail packet for the proggy to run!!!!

ROT3 is a ML encryption proggy which encrypts all text
between Alt T and Alt T in a message. It should go in
the C directory.

Any troubles let me know!

Roy
