	Rome wasn't built in a day, but this game was in a weekend.  I made
it because there used to be a 2 on 2 hockey game on the c-64 that I loved.
It is simple, but very fun!

If you want a more enhanced version of this game, plus the registered version
of ARTILLERUS (a real example of my capability) send $10 to

As for directions, you don't need them, it IS that simple.(games are to 3)
If you want to draw new players, goalies, rink, etc.  send them to me, the
game could sure use them.

HAVE FUN!
