Wo,

I have just spent the entire day making all this stuff fit on one
disk, and I'm more than a little tired of the 1756 block limit. Not
only this disk but the bum5.lha disk as well. BUM will be released
on CD only from now on... :)

Anyway, no LHA program could fit so here's the instructions and
being programmers I'm sure you can make it happen, (unauthorised
version of lha was in bum4)

lha e bum5 bum5:      ;bum5: needs to be a completely blank floppy.

lha e bb17 blitz2:    ;thats a copy of the program disk mind you

The skidbeta needs to go on a bootable floppy with the following
files, please make sure they are all there before creating an
archive for distribution (DO spread it please). Harddisk
users should probably use it on floppy before trusting it on
their HD.

 s (dir)
   Startup-Sequence  ;(loadwb endcli)
 libs (dir)
   diskfont.library                 icon.library
   mathtrans.library
 l (dir)
   Disk-Validator                   port-handler
 devs (dir)
   serial.device                    system-configuration
 c (dir)
   echo                             endcli
   loadwb                           ppmore
   Run

Oh, I had to delete the shapes files needed in my AF articles, just
load the IFF files into shapesmaker, center handle and save as
.shapes.

Advanced Programmers:

The libsdev really got clipped due to shortage of space, all the new
libraries go from BASIC to BLITZLIBS:BASIC, however I did leave the
source code to my gadtools and display libraries so don't complain.
Hmm, make a resident blitzlibs:libmacs.res from libmacs.bb if you need
upgrading.

There's some new includes that Thomas have done in the BlitzBlank
drawer which you might want to include with your amigalibs.res if
you're into low level systems programming.

And now with the last 1K of disk space..

WANTED

BLITZ2 COOKBOOK: we've already got a publisher lined up so if you
have done some nice project in Blitz2 and feel like documenting
it then we need you. This will be a strictly hippy profit sharing
venture and I'd like to do a really nice series. Now, I'm sure you
want me to concentrate on the new manuals so please help us out
on this front...

EXAMPLE PROGRAMS: we desperately need good examples to accompany
new documentation (note lack of clarity in BUM5 docs!) so anyone
interested in doing amazing stuff in 50 lines or less with the
new (or old) commands please get onto it...

ACID1 CD: we will be pressing a CD32 disk hopefully third week
of November with as many Blitz2 games as possible, if it's not
great on gameplay just go alternative on style, trippy light
shows and suggestive/raunchy graphics to be encouraged but I
do want 10 good games as well so againg get to it

OK, no TED update and no debugger advancemnets, these are under
way and will feature in BUM6 which will definately be before
XMas, infact we'll say November20 to coincide with,,,,, yup
you got it SKIDMARKS!

                   Later (thats my last byte gone) .... Simon
