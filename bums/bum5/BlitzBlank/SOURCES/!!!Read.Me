These are the BlitzBlank sources and includes. The sources are saved
as ASCII. If you wish to XINCLUDE the Screenreq in your own programs
then load it in TED and save it again before use. And don`t forget
to give credit!!

"Signal" is the program that tells a Module to stop, which is not
started from BlitzBlank, but from the CLI for testing.
