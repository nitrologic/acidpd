Editors Note:

Due to space restrictions I can't include the executables so
first loadup source/blitzblank.bb and create the blitzblank
executable. You need to keep the BlitzBlank.info icon as
is, once you get this working (must be run from workbench)
so you need to create modules with each of the source codes
in Blitz2. You should be able to create the following modules
in the modules drawer when finished:

  BB.Aquarium                      BB.Crumble
  BB.Fade                          BB.Flash
  BB.Lines                         BB.Melt
  BB.Modules.config                BB.Mosaic
  BB.Pyro                          BB.Pyro_GC
  BB.Random                        BB.Spot
  BB.Tiles

Sorry about the inconvenience, now over to Thomas...

Well, yet another screenblanker. But this one has the following features:

- AGA/OS 3.0 compatible
- most modules graphic-cards compatible (tested with Picasso II)
- modular (more modules to come, maybe one from YOU?)
- fancy modules ;-)
- nice GUI-interface
- screenmode-requester built-in (because 2.0 ASL doesn`t have one)
- ASL-filerequester
- system-friendly
- Commodity
- mouseblanker included
- copyrighted FreeWare
- sourcecodes in BlitzBasic 2 included. Look at it, get ideas from it but
  don`t change it!

Copyright and warranty notice:
------------------------------

BlitzBlank is copyrighted by Thomas Boerkel. It must not be included with
commercial programs (exception: BlitzBasic 2) and may not appear on
PD/FD-disks with a cost of more than $5/DM 5.-.
The right to include BlitzBlank in the Fred Fish Library is especially
granted (and wanted ;-) ). This also applies to possible CD-ROM releases
of the Library.
You may copy and use BlitzBlank free with no cost (FreeWare).
You may only distribute BlitzBlank with all files from the original archive.
There is NO warranty! Use BlitzBlank at your own risk. The author is NOT
responsible for ANY damage caused by BlitzBlank.

The same applies to all modules with the exception that they are
copyrighted by their respective authors.


What you need:
--------------

- an Amiga ;-)
- AmigaOS 2.04 or higher (if you have 1.x then upgrade NOW!)


How to install:
---------------

It`s simple. Just copy BlitzBlank and BlitzBlank.info in your SYS:WbStartup
drawer and the module-directory somewhere you like.

In this module-directory the BlitzBlank module-config-file
"BB.Modules.config" will be automatically created.

BlitzBlank will then be started automatically at bootup.

Currently, BlitzBlank can only be started from WB.


How to use:
-----------

The first time you start BlitzBlank it will popup it`s window immediatly.
You should change this after you made your configuration.

First, choose the correct path to the module-directory.

If you close BlitzBlank`s window, your changes will be remembered by
BlitzBlank as long as it is not terminated.
If you wish to make the changes permanent, click on the "Save"-button.

You can move through the different string-gadgets (text-fields) by pressing
<TAB> and <SHIFT-TAB>.

All gadgets can be reached/used with the underlined key in the gadget`s
label.

Because BlitzBlank is a commodity, you can also popup/close it`s window and
terminate it with the System-Commodity "Exchange".

After you have configured a module, you HAVE to close the module`s
config-window to make changes active.


The GUI and its gadgets:
------------------------

This pops up the Screenmoderequester where you choose your
favourite screenmode and number of colors. Please note that all modules

This lets you test the chosen module.

Config (key c/C):

This displays information about BlitzBlank.

This quits BlitzBlank.

Modules (key m/M):

the module`s config-window.

ModPri (key d/D):
With this slider you choose the module`s task-priority.

Blankkey (key b/B):
In this field you type in the key that should blank immediatly.

Path (key p/P):

on the drawer-gadget left from the field to get a filerequester. Or
you press <HELP> while the field is activated.

Popup at startuptime (key u/U):
Here you choose wether BlitzBlank should popup its window automatically
at start.

Blank Mouse (key l/L):
Here you choose whether your mousepointer should be blanked at a keypress
and/or after a selectable amount of seconds.

In this field you type in the amount of seconds till the mousepointer
should be blanked.

Popkey (key k/K):
In this field you type in the key that should pop up BlitzBlank`s window.

Timeout (key o/O):
In this field you type the number of seconds till BlitzBlank should
activate a blankmodule. A number of 0 means that BlitzBlank will never

How to program modules:
-----------------------

Please refer to the Programmers.doc.


Troubleshooting:
----------------

If a module seems not to work, then a lack of memory might be the cause,
making it impossible for the module to open it's screen.

If BlitzBlank displays a requester telling you, that a module is not
working, then maybe the module isn`t present any more or is damaged.

If you`re using XPK-XFH and you`ve problems with the saving of the
module-configurations then get yourself the newest XPK-package
(thanks to Brian Larson for telling me this)


Bugs and suggestions:
---------------------

If you find any bugs or if you have any suggestions then please let me
know. Tell me your EXACT configuration and the EXACT circumstances
where you found the bug.
