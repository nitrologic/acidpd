Blackout - built-in module from BlitzBlank:
-------------------------------------------
This one is always available and will simply open a black screen in the
screenmode of your choice with one bitplane.

Aquarium - Copyright by Thomas Boerkel:
---------------------------------------
Aquarium shows fishes swimming around on your screen. It opens two screens
(doublebuffering) of your selected screenmode in 8 colors. In the
config-window, you choose the number of fishes. Graphics by Michael Weber.
Note: Aquarium uses lots of CHIP-RAM and is not compatible with graphic-
      cards.

Crumble - Copyright by Thomas Boerkel:
--------------------------------------
Crumble "crumbles" the actual screen. Choose the speed in the
config-window.

Fade - Copyright by Thomas Boerkel:
-----------------------------------
This module softly fades out your current screen. The percentage of
the remaining brightness can be configured in the config-window from
0% to 99%. Fade takes advantage of AGA for smoother fading.

Flash - Copyright by Thomas Boerkel:
------------------------------------
Flash shows flashes in the dark. The max. number of flashes can be chosen
in the config-window.

Lines - Copyright by Thomas Boerkel and Juergen Denner:
-------------------------------------------------------
Lines draws a couple of colored lines on a black screen in the screenmode
of your choice. In the config-window, you choose the number of lines to
draw. The draw-algorithm is from Juergen Denner.

size and speed.

Mosaic - Copyright by Thomas Boerkel:

Mosaic puzzles your actual screen. In the config-window you choose the
size and speed.

Pyro - Copyright by Thomas Boerkel and Wolfgang Boerkel:
--------------------------------------------------------
Pyro shoots fireworks on a black screen in the screenmode of your choice.
In the config-window you can set the number of flares and the
doublebuffer-option. Doublebuffer makes things a bit smoother but costs
double amount of CHIP-RAM and is a bit slower because it tries to keep in
sync all the time. Mathematics by Wolfgang Boerkel.
Note: Pyro is not compatible with graphic-cards. Use Pyro_GC instead.

Pyro_GC - Copyright by Thomas Boerkel and Wolfgang Boerkel:
-----------------------------------------------------------
Just the same as Pyro, but compatible with graphic-cards.

Random - Copyright by Thomas Boerkel:
-------------------------------------
This "module" runs randomly the others. You can choose which other modules
to run in Random`s config-window.

Spot - Copyright by Thomas Boerkel:
-----------------------------------
Spot moves spotlights over your actual screen. You will notice that
changes of that screen can also be seen, if "Update" is activated.
Spot only works, if it can open a screen with one bitplane more than the
screen it is blanking. Otherwise it will simply show a black screen. In
Spot`s config-window you can choose the speed of the spotlights, the
number, the size, fading and the Update-option (disables fading).
Note:  If you want more than 1 spotlight, it uses double amount of CHIP-RAM.
Note2: If Spot hangs sometimes on your system, then please turn Smooth off,
       try a smaller size or use more than 1 spot.

Tiles - Copyright by Thomas Boerkel:
-----------------------------------
Tiles will devide your actual frontscreen in many pieces and will move them
around. In the config-window you can choose a border for the pieces and the
speed of movement.
