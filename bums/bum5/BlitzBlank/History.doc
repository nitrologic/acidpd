1.01
----

- BlitzBlank:  - Doubleclicking on a module in the modulelist brings up
                 the module's config-window
               - BlitzBlank's window now shows a busypointer when nothing
                 can be done with it (e.g. when a requester is displayed)
               - BlitzBlank no longer eats memory if a module cannot be
                 started
               - The WB-screentitle is the same as the BlitzBlank-window's
                 if the BlitzBlank window is activated
               - BlitzBlank's popkey now also brings the WB to front
                 (thanks to Brian Larson)
               - BlitzBlank no longer reacts while loading a module
                 (thanks to Brian Larson)

- Spot:        - Smooth is smoother, number can be 1-100, size can be
                 10-150

- Pyro:        - This was accidently the same as Pyro_GC. So it is now
                 faster

- Random:      - If you've selected more than one module the same module
                 won't be activated two times in a row.
               - Random now waits until the other module is ready

- Crumble:     - This was missing in the modules.doc

- All modules: - More information in the info-requester
               - Better default-values
