Hi there All

Here is just a quick example of Using Arexx to extend your
programmes, this little example uses the phonebook listing
out of the User guide and adds a dial gadget to it.

If you have a copy of TERMINUS (an awesome shareware comms programme)
running with the port name TERMINUS1 (if you only have one copy running
then it will be called that), and you click on the dial gadget, then this
programme will ring the currently displayed number through the comms prog

I did this REAL quickly, so there is no features like it bringing
terminus screen to the front (just use Right Amiga N or M) but its a quick
example of how you can use another programmes Arexx commands through a 
arexx port in your blitz programme for added functionality

PS: I recommend you REGISTER for terminus if you use it, its a great 
programme and the script commandset (a full BASIC interpreter) is built in
which is just waaay cool.....

Roger.
